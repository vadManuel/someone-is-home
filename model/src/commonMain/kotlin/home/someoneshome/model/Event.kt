/**
 * A fact. Past tense, already happened, and the only thing the rules consume.
 *
 * Events are what the recording stores and what replay feeds back. Every one carries the [Tick]
 * it occurred at, sampled at the edge — the rules never ask what time it is.
 *
 * **This set is deliberately partial.** It covers the spine the round trace walks; several
 * systems it names are still blocked on open design decisions (Egress node designation F-001,
 * the SystemIntegrity denominator F-005, carry state across a meeting F-014). Inventing events
 * for those here would encode a guess as a decision.
